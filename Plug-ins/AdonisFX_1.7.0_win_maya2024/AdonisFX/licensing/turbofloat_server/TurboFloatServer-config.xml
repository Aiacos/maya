		We recommend setting this to 1 thread per CPU "core".

		If you set this value to "0" then TurboFloat Server will automatically
		detect how many cores the computer has and use that value.

		Setup how long a license lease should last. The time is in seconds.

		We recommend 30 minutes (i.e. 1800 seconds).

		The shorter you make this time the more often the "client" programs
		will have to contact this server, and thus the more load on the server
		and the more traffic on the network.

		The only time "long" leases will be a problem is if the client programs
		end abruptly without first telling the server that the lease is no longer
		needed. Thus a "zombie" lease will take up one of the lease slots until
		it expires.

		The absolute minimum time you can use is 30 seconds.

		Do not set this to very long values because you won't be able to get rid
		of the lease in cases where the client-app shuts down un-cleanly. 30 minutes
		is a good default.

		The log file to write errors, warnings, and any information.

		file: Where the log file will be written / appended to. The floating
			  license server must have access to this file and the directory
			  must exist.

			  You can use either absolute path or a relative path. If you use
			  a relative path then the log file will be written relative to
			  the TurboFloat Server executable file.


		level: The amount of information you want TurboFloat Server to output
			   to the log file. These are the possible level settings:

				"notification": Records when leases are created, removed, expired,
							   and other nonessential, but possibly interesting
							   information. This level also includes all other level
							   outputs (warning, error).

				"warning": Records things that are wrong with your configuration
						   or other things that need to be fixed. This level also
						   includes the next level of output (error).

				"error": Records when TurboFloat Server fails to do things it needs
						to do. For example, failures to load configuration data,
						failure to process data, etc.

				"none": No log file will be written.

		Set how often to recheck this TurboFloat Server's activation. This TurboFloat
		Server instance will contact the activation servers through wyday.com on port
		80 or port 443 depending on a number of factors. (So, http://wyday.com and
		https://wyday.com must be whitelisted for this process so that it can contact
		those sites).

		days_between: How many days between check. Minimum 1. Maximum 90. We recommend 5.
		grace: The number of grace period days on an internet failure. Maximum 14.
