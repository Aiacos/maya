First place the PerseusRigging folder where you want it to be.
for example: "C:/PerseusRigging".

This folder is a good place to keep it, but it can be anywhere.

Once you have the PerseusRigging folder where you want it to be,
then just drag`n`drop the "install.mel" file into Maya (drop in any viewport).

This will add the PerseusRigging tool to the current shelf.

Example of rig created with perseus auto rig, can be found in the "exampleFile" folder.
